Enforce HTTPS — Unavailable for your site because your domain is not properly configured to support HTTPS (cc.coolshell.in) — [Troubleshooting custom domains](https://docs.github.com/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains/#https-errors)

HTTPS provides a layer of encryption that prevents others from snooping on or tampering with traffic to your site.
When HTTPS is enforced, your site will only be served over HTTPS. [Learn more about securing your GitHub Pages site with HTTPS.](https://docs.github.com/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https)

检查过整站代码，没有看出异常，DNS记录正常，二级域名可正常访问，前端页面也没有看出异常，为什么 "Enforce HTTPS" 仍然不可用？
